When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When working on different computers or collaborating with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    - Because you could be working on your local repository, so an automatic
    pull would have to erase your progress, or let you save your it some way,
    which probably would be confusing.
    
    - Because some branches pushed to GitHub by other users might not be of your
    interest.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    - Forks copy a repository from GitHub to GitHub, and indicate on the created
    repository that it was forked by the first one.

    - Clones copy a repository from GitHub to a "non-GitHub" machine or from a
    non-GitHub machine to another non-GitHub machine. In the former case, also
    create a remote poiting to the GitHub repository. (I'm not sure if that
    happens also in the latter case).

    - Branches are labels that point to one commit.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
