When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When working on different computers or collaborating with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    - Because you could be working on your local repository, so an automatic
    pull would have to erase your progress, or let you save your it some way,
    which probably would be confusing.
    
    - Because some branches pushed to GitHub by other users might not be of your
    interest.
